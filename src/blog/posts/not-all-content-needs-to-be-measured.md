The biggest myth in B2B content marketing? That every piece needs to be measurable. That it needs to convert.
That thinking is borrowed from B2C, and it's holding us back.

Because in B2B, it’s never just one person buying with a credit card. 

It's:
– nurturing an internal champion (who is the only thing pushing the deal forward)
– a buying committee (who's more concerned about budget than pain point)
– a timeline that spans months (especially in upcoming summer months) 
– competing priorities, limited resources, and internal politics (need I say more)

So if you judge your content by whether it immediately drives a demo, you're missing the point.

The real job of B2B content is to earn preference over time.

At Mutiny, and now helping build content engines across industries at storyarb, I’ve seen the same pattern repeat:

The best content programs build a system that earns attention, earns trust, and earns the right to be the first call when a prospect finally enters buying mode.

Here’s what that system looks like:

1. Post regularly on LinkedIn to meet people where they already are
2. Drive curiosity clicks to your site
3. Turn attention into newsletter signups
4. Show up in their inbox with genuinely valuable insight

It's that simple.

Repeat that flywheel for a few months and something magical happens:

You become the default. 

Not because of a flashy campaign—but because you showed up consistently and with clarity.

And yes, measurement still matters. Just not in isolation. I look at:

– Growth: Are we growing our newsletter list with the right people?
– Engagement: Are people opening, clicking, replying?
– Conversion: Are sales calling out content as a reason deals are moving?

That’s how you turn content into a competitive advantage.
