Confession: I’m a fraud.

While I create content across dozens of topics, I’m not actually an expert in most of them. My secret? I know how to extract knowledge from the people who are.

As much as I’d love to take credit for all the novel insights I’ve shared over the years, none of it would’ve been possible without gathering intel from subject matter experts far smarter than me.

But how do you conduct a *great* SME interview?

Here’s what I’ve learned from doing hundreds of them.


## 1 — Source widely and wisely

The best insights often come from unexpected places. Don’t rely on the same industry influencers everyone else is quoting.

Instead, look to:

- **Internal SMEs** hiding in different departments (they’re sitting on goldmines of untapped knowledge)
- **Customers** using your product or service in unique ways (real-world stories beat theory every time)
- **Partners** with complementary expertise (fresh perspectives = fresh content)


<br>Some of my most valuable interviews have been with people who’ve never written a blog post or spoken at a conference. They’re doing the work, not talking about it.


## 2 — Start from the finish

Know exactly what final content piece you’re creating and reverse engineer your questions.

- Writing a **how-to guide**? Focus on process details.
- Producing **thought leadership**? Dig into opinions, tradeoffs, and predictions.


<br>This clarity keeps both you and your SME focused—and avoids meandering interviews that go nowhere.


## 3 — Come prepared, but follow the gold

Always arrive with a structured set of questions, but be ready to abandon them.

When an SME mentions something unexpected or intriguing, that’s your cue to *double click* and go deeper.

The best insights are rarely surfaced by your prepared questions. They emerge when you follow interesting tangents.


## 4 — Embrace the rephrase

Don’t be afraid to ask your SME to rephrase technical concepts.

Try prompts like:

- “Could you explain that as if I’m a beginner?”
- “How would you describe this to someone outside our industry?”


Their simplified explanations often become the clearest—and most quotable—parts of your content.


## 5 — Make it a conversation, not an interrogation

The best SME interviews feel like real discussions.

Listen actively. Show genuine curiosity. Connect the dots between their points.

When people feel understood, they open up—and that’s where the good stuff lives.


Nearly every piece of content I've created starts as an SME interview. That’s how I consistently extract tactical and strategic insights that grow our clients’ audiences and build real industry credibility.

It also makes the writing process a whole lot easier.

And yes, it makes me look a lot smarter than I actually am.
