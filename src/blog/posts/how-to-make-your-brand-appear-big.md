Big brands with small marketing teams will be the norm, not the exception, in a world with AI. Here’s what I’ve learned from punching above our weight class at Mutiny:


## 1. **Everyone's A Contributor. And Everyone's A Manager**  
In a small team, you need to operate as both the strategist and the executor. 

Learn how to ask your teammates for help executing on your idea. Be willing to step up when they need you to do something outside your scope.


## 2. **Prove The Concept, Then Systematize**  
The in-house team should be in charge of coming up with new ideas, building the prototype, and validating its impact. 

Once it works, outsource to an AI workflow, <a href="/blog/in-house-vs-agency/">agency</a>, or freelancer right away.


## 3. **Learn To Ride Waves Instead Of Creating Them**  
Trying to create trends is expensive, unpredictable, and rarely worth it. Instead, find where the momentum already exists and position your brand to align with it. 


Having a unique POV about a common trend will take you far.


## 4. **Dedicate 30% To "Always On" Marketing, 70% To Campaigns**  
Your ongoing marketing keeps you visible, but campaigns are what drive big spikes in attention and impact. Balancing the two ensures you’re consistently present while still creating moments that move the needle.


## 5. **Know Your Customer (Really, Really Well)**  
The answers to your biggest marketing challenges are in the calls your sales and customer success teams are already having. Dive headfirst into your Gong transcripts. 


Look for patterns, pain points, and wins. Then, use those insights to shape your messaging, campaigns, and product positioning.


Small teams don’t mean small results. With focus, insight, and execution, you can punch far above your weight class.
