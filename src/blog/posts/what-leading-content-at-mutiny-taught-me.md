Leading content marketing at Mutiny has been the most transformative job of my career so far. My biggest lessons learned about content and marketing over the last 3 years:


1. **Content drives revenue, but not in the way you think.**  
Measuring the performance of every single piece of content might seem smart, but pageviews isn’t pipeline. My POV is content and all marketing types should be measured on sales meetings booked at the program level.


How many meetings came inbound? Outbound? Events? Ads? 

This orients the entire marketing team around the same revenue generating end-goal (meetings booked), while still giving you enough granularity to diagnose.


2. **Marketing should be in service to sales.**  
The purpose of marketing is to make sales easier. That means you need to meet with your sellers consistently to hear what’s going on at the frontline. Listen closely for common reasons for lost deals, won deals, and objections they face every day. 


Then design campaigns around that topic (see below). Your prospects will find it useful, your sellers will love you, and it’ll help hit your pipeline target.


3. **Always-On Marketing + Campaigns = Outsized results.**  
“Always-on” marketing is the daily drumbeat of your marketing program—ads, social, SEO, email, outbound. These will perform ok on their own, but will eventually reach a baseline. 


By adding an integrated campaign theme and activating it across all your marketing channels at the same time, you’ll see a huge spike that quarter. But you’ll also notice an increase in the new baseline after the campaign finishes. 


Aim for 3–4 integrated campaigns a year to stay timely and not burn out the team.


4. **Do one thing really well, then expand.**  
Content teams are notorious for spreading ourselves too thin. Too many channels, too many formats, too many goals. 


My advice: start with a single blog format, a newsletter, and LinkedIn. They are still by far the most effective B2B content channels from my experience. Once you’ve got your processes down and are seeing results, add short and long-form video. 


Design your content formats so that they feed each other (interview turns into newsletter, turns into social, turns into ad, etc.).


5. **Brand makes everything easier.**  
Everything from customer acquisition to hiring is easier when your company’s brand is strong. I think this will be even more true in the age of AI where features will become commoditized even faster. 


But a strong brand doesn’t come from a cool logo (though that helps). Your brand is a rolling 3 month perception of all your combined public touchpoints. 


Content remains the most predictable and scalable way to build a brand.
