Great content that nobody sees is worthless. Distribution is just as important as creation.

**Owned channels**: Your website, blog, and email list are your most valuable distribution channels. Build these assets consistently.

**Social media**: Share content across relevant platforms, but adapt the format for each. What works on LinkedIn won't work on Twitter.

**Communities**: Find where your audience gathers—forums, Slack groups, Reddit communities. Share valuable content without being spammy.

**Partnerships**: Collaborate with other creators, companies, or influencers in your space. Guest posts and co-created content expand your reach.

**Repurposing**: Turn one piece of content into multiple formats—blog post becomes a video, becomes a podcast, becomes a Twitter thread.

The best distribution strategy is one that reaches your specific audience where they already spend time.
