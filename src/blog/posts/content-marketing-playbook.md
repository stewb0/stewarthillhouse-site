Effective content marketing requires a systematic approach. Here's a playbook that works:

**Ideation**: Start with your audience's pain points. What questions do they have? What challenges do they face? Use tools like Answer the Public or customer interviews to find topics.

**Creation**: Focus on depth over breadth. One comprehensive guide is more valuable than ten surface-level posts. Aim to be the definitive resource on your topic.

**Optimization**: Optimize for both search engines and humans. Use keywords naturally, structure content for readability, and include clear calls-to-action.

**Distribution**: Don't just publish and hope. Share across multiple channels—your website, social media, email newsletters, and relevant communities.

**Measurement**: Track what matters. Look beyond vanity metrics to engagement, leads generated, and revenue attributed to content.
