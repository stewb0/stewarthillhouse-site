Page views and social shares feel good, but they don't tell you if your content is actually working.

Focus on engagement metrics: time on page, scroll depth, and comments show whether people are actually reading and interacting with your content.

Track conversion metrics: how many readers become leads? How many leads become customers? This connects content directly to business outcomes.

Measure content efficiency: how long does it take to create? What's the cost per lead? This helps you optimize your content investment.

Look at content attribution: which pieces drive the most qualified leads? Which support customers through the buying journey?

Remember: the goal isn't to create viral content. It's to create content that drives business results.
